- 1.  Click on the "Fork" icon at the top of the page.  This creates a copy (clone) of the master that is now your repository.
- 2.  Copy the HTTPS clone URL from the box next to your repository on the right. Check the link, it should have your Github user name in it. 
- 3. Download Git for your operating system:  http://www.git-scm.com/downloads. This program allows R to interface with Github.
- 3. In R, select new project, then version control, then Git.  Here is where you will paste the link from the Github clone.

- You are all set, now you can start changing your script.  When you have made some changes you feel good about, "commit" saves changes to your project file on your system.
